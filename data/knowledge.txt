Purchase Order
A Purchase Order (PO) is a formal document issued by a buyer to a seller indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. POs are legally binding once accepted by the supplier. Key purposes include specifying purchase requirements, authorizing procurement, and maintaining records for auditing and budget tracking.
Purchase Requisition
A Purchase Requisition is an internal document generated by employees or departments to request the purchase of goods or services. It triggers the procurement process and requires approval before a PO can be generated. Requisitions help organizations control spending and ensure that purchases are necessary and authorized.
Custom Views
Custom Views refer to tailored data displays within procurement software, allowing users to view specific information, such as pending POs or invoices, based on filters or criteria relevant to their role. This enhances efficiency and data visibility for different users.
Content Groups
Content Groups are categories or collections of items, documents, or resources within a procurement system. They help organize procurement data (like suppliers, products, or contracts) to streamline access, searching, and reporting.
Rules and Responsibilities of Admin
Procurement admins are responsible for managing system settings, user permissions, workflows, supplier data, compliance protocols, and overall procurement processes. Admins ensure that only authorized personnel can create or approve transactions and maintain data integrity and security.
Company Addresses
Company Addresses in procurement systems refer to the recorded locations of a company's facilities, such as headquarters, branch offices, and warehouses. These are essential for tax calculation, delivery planning, and compliant transaction records.
Current Version of Coupa
This refers to the implementation of the latest available release of the Coupa procurement platform. Staying on the current version ensures access to recent features, security patches, and regulatory updates.
Approval Chains
Approval Chains are predefined sequences of users or roles who must review and authorize procurement requests before they proceed. These workflows ensure accountability and compliance by routing requisitions and purchases through designated approvers, either sequentially or in parallel.
Contracts
Contracts are formal agreements with suppliers, covering terms such as pricing, delivery timelines, quality standards, and penalties. Procurement systems often manage contracts centrally, ensuring that purchases comply with negotiated terms and reducing maverick spending.
Payment Methods
Payment Methods specify how a company will pay suppliers—options include wire transfer, credit card, ACH, or checks. These methods must comply with both internal policies and supplier capabilities.
Procurement Workflow
Procurement Workflow describes the end-to-end process for acquiring goods and services, from requisition and approval through PO issuance, receipt, invoicing, and payment. Automated workflows in software like Coupa help optimize efficiency and consistency.
Coupa Hands-On Questions
These are practical scenarios or exercises involving the Coupa system, such as creating requisitions, processing POs, configuring approval chains, or generating reports. Hands-on activities help users gain functional expertise and solve real-world procurement tasks.
Legal Entities
Legal Entities are distinct corporate bodies within an organization that can enter contracts and own assets. Accurate setup in procurement systems ensures that transactions, compliance, tax, and reporting are correctly aligned with each part of the business.
 



Basics of Procurement
Procurement is the systematic process of acquiring goods, services, or works from external sources, typically via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The standard steps are:
•	Identifying needs: For example, a manufacturing company’s production planner realizes they need 1,000 units of steel for the next month’s run.
•	Source suppliers: The procurement team researches suppliers, requests quotes, and gathers competitive pricing.
•	Submit purchase requisition: The production planner formally requests steel by entering a purchase requisition in the system.
•	Evaluate/select supplier: Using quotes and historical vendor data, the team chooses the supplier offering best value (considering price, quality, and reliability).
•	Negotiate & issue PO: Price, delivery, and terms are negotiated, then the purchase order (PO) is sent to the chosen supplier.
•	Receive & inspect goods: On receipt, the goods are checked to confirm quantity and quality match the order.
•	Invoice & payment: The supplier invoices the company. After a three-way match (PO, invoice, delivery receipt), payment is processed by accounts payable.

1. Procurement Management (by Avik Munshi)
Procurement management refers to the entire set of processes and activities organizations use to acquire goods and services from external suppliers. This includes planning purchases, developing standards, supplier research, value analysis, contract negotiation, purchasing, handling logistics, supplier evaluation, and maintaining supplier relationships. A key aim is ensuring quality, timeline, compliance and cost-effectiveness.

•	PO Change Request/Cancellation/Soft Close:
•	Change: Users/Suppliers can submit change requests (quantities, dates, etc.), routed for re-approval.
•	Cancel: PO can be fully voided up to a certain status.
•	Soft Close: PO auto-closes when remaining balance is negligible or all goods/services have been received.



The S2P (Source-to-Pay) process is the complete procurement lifecycle—from identifying business needs to sourcing suppliers, managing contracts, procuring goods/services, receiving them, processing invoices, and making payment. Below is a detailed explanation of each stage in the S2P process flow.
________________________________________
1. Spend Analysis
Spend analysis is the foundation of S2P. It involves analyzing all procurement expenditures to identify patterns, cost-saving opportunities, supplier dependencies, and compliance issues.
Example: A company discovers through spend analysis that it buys similar IT equipment from five suppliers. By consolidating to one vendor, it negotiates bulk savings.
Steps:
•	Gather spend data from systems (ERPs, POs, invoices).
•	Categorize by supplier, category, department, or region.
•	Identify top spending areas or duplicate suppliers.
•	Formulate strategic sourcing decisions based on insights.

________________________________________
2. Supplier/Vendor Selection & Onboarding (SIM)
Supplier Information Management (SIM) ensures suppliers meet organizational, regulatory, and risk standards.
Stages:
•	Identification: Research potential suppliers through market analysis.
•	Prequalification: Assess financial health, capabilities, references, and compliance certifications.
•	Onboarding: Register and collect supplier data (bank details, tax IDs, certifications).
•	Risk & Performance Monitoring: Use KPIs to track supplier delivery, quality, and reliability.
Example: A manufacturer onboarded an adhesive supplier using automated SIM software to ensure ISO compliance and sustainability verification.

________________________________________
3. Sourcing & Negotiation (RFI, RFQ, RFP)
Strategic sourcing uses competitive bidding to secure cost-effective, compliant, and high-quality supplies.
Documents:
•	RFI (Request for Information): Gather data about potential suppliers.
•	RFQ (Request for Quotation): Collect precise pricing for specified items.
•	RFP (Request for Proposal): Detailed submissions on pricing, capability, and approach.
Negotiation Goals:
•	Price and discounts
•	Delivery timelines
•	Service-level agreements (SLAs)
•	Legal and compliance terms
Example: A telecom company runs an RFP for network equipment and negotiates better unit pricing for bulk purchases.

________________________________________
4. Contracting (CLM)
Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) defines and governs supplier relationships.
Steps:
1.	Draft: Create agreement templates aligned with business terms.
2.	Negotiate: Finalize terms, payment conditions, escalation clauses.
3.	Approve: Route for internal legal and finance approval.
4.	Store: Save in a centralized contract repository for access.
5.	Monitor: Track expiration, renewal, compliance, and performance.
Example: An IT company uses Coupa CLM to auto-renew annual software contracts before expiry.

________________________________________
5. Purchase Requisition (PR)
A Purchase Requisition (PR) is an internal request to procure goods/services.
Steps:
•	A department identifies need (e.g., “20 new laptops”).
•	The requestor creates a PR in the system (Coupa/ERP).
•	Approval flows based on spending limit or role hierarchy.
•	Once approved, procurement team issues a Purchase Order.
Example: An HR manager raises a PR for office chairs, triggering an approval chain up to the procurement head.
________________________________________
6. Purchase Order (PO) Issuance
A PO is a legally binding document outlining the item, price, quantity, and supplier details.
Steps:
•	System auto-generates PO from approved PR.
•	Supplier acknowledges PO (accept/reject).
•	Updates flow into the procurement and finance workflows.
Example: Business issues a PO for 50 servers post vendor confirmation, including shipping & payment terms.

________________________________________
7. Goods Receipt (GR) / Service Confirmation
Confirms that ordered goods/services meet agreed specifications.
Steps:
•	Warehouse or project team acknowledges receipt.
•	Data logged as “Goods Receipt Note (GRN)” in system.
•	Non-conformance triggers inspection or return flow.
Example: Quality team inspects a batch of machine parts, updates GRN with pass/fail metrics.
________________________________________
8. Invoicing
Suppliers issue an invoice detailing the amount owed.
Steps:
•	Supplier submits invoice via supplier portal or email.
•	Invoice data recorded in accounts payable module.
•	Validation occurs against PO and GR data (3-way match check).
Example: Invoice for $20,000 received; quantity and price match PO, approved automatically.
________________________________________
9. Invoice Matching (2-Way & 3-Way)
2-Way Match: Invoice matches PO (usually for services).
3-Way Match: Invoice matches PO and GR (used for tangible goods).
Benefits: Prevents overpayment, ensures received goods were ordered, detects discrepancies.
Example: Invoice for 100 keyboards passes 3-way match successfully.
________________________________________
10. Approval
If variance is within tolerance ranges, system auto-approves.
Otherwise, invoice is routed to approvers for correction or approval.
Workflows depend on: Invoice amount, budget owner, category, or department.
________________________________________
11. Payment
Once invoice is verified and approved:
•	Scheduled payment date determined (e.g., Net 30 days).
•	Finance initiates payment (EFT, ACH, or check).
•	Posting in ledger (ERP integration).
•	Confirmation sent to supplier.
Example: Invoice cleared for $10,000; payment released via ACH and reconciled in accounts payable ledger.
________________________________________
How S2P Ties Together in Practice
In a real-world Coupa or SAP environment:
•	Spend trends drive sourcing events.
•	SIM enables secure onboarding.
•	CLM ensures compliant contracts.
•	Requisitions and POs automate procurement requests.
•	Digital GR and invoice-matching complete the transaction flow.
•	Automated approvals & payments close the financial loop efficiently, enhancing compliance, visibility, and cost control.
